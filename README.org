* Organize Yourself with Org-Mode
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Due to the way Org works, TODO items, time-stamped items, and tagged headlines can be scattered throughout a file or even a number of files. To get an overview of open action items, or of events that are important for a particular date, this information must be collected, sorted and displayed in an organized way.  - orgmode.org

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Org-Drill is an extension for Org mode. Org-Drill uses a spaced repetition algorithm to conduct interactive "drill sessions", using org files as sources of facts to be memorised. Each topic is treated as a "flash card". The material to be remembered is presented to the student in random order. The student rates his or her recall of each item, and this information is used to schedule the item for later revision.
